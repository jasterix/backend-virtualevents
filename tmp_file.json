It's my gift to NYC this summer.</p> <p>Come and experience how this unique meditation can help you purify your body/mind and unleash the creative power within you.</p> <p>* Increase self-awareness<br/>* Stronger emotional intelligence<br/>* Greater mental clarity, focus and inspiration.</p> <p>Bodhi Meditation<br/>Energize your body<br/>Strenthen your mind</p> <p>Bodhi Meditation is a form of energy healing.</p> <p>Bodhi Meditation is unique in the following ways</p> <p>1). It channels universal energy rather than working with what’s within one person. It transcends the genetic and physical limits of just one being by relying and drawing energy from the entire universe.</p> <p>2). The entire human body is the receiver of this energy. The energy’s effects on the body do not rely on certain meridian paths or pressure points of the body, which are the common requirements for many types of the Qi Gong practices.</p> <p>Students will experience two forms of Bodhi Meditation.<br/>* Seated<br/>* Movement</p> <p>Your class instructor is Nan Ni Gilbert. Nan is a NYS licensed acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist. Nan is also one of the most advanced Bodhi Meditation energy healer in North America.</p> <p>NYC class schedule:</p> <p>Tuesday 7:00-8:30pm (Every Tuesday thru September 27, 2013)<br/>Friday 7:00-8:30pm (Every Friday thru September 27, 2013)</p> <p>We have the room till 9:00pm so feel free to ask Nan your personal health questions after the class.</p> <p>Please arrive early for class intro/setup.</p> <p>Class basic info:<br/>* Loose fitting clothes is recommended but not required.<br/>* Some people bring their own yoga mat for the seated meditation part. This is not a requirement as we have chairs for everyone.<br/>* Cellphones needed to be turned off during the class.</p> <p>Contact: ladyni88@gmail.com</p> ",
